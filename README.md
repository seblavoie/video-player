# Video player

This is a quick personal electron app I created to be able to quickly watch a series of video files. It allows you to specify a folder which contains videos files or a folder structure that contains video files, and it will create a playlist from those videos. The video next video will autoplay when one finishes and the interface will allow you to control the playback speed. 

- Works with your file structure
- Playback speed control
- Automatically plays next video
